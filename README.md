# WeatherApp
A minimal modern UI weather app developed using React Native Expo . When you open this app, it will immediately display the weather information for your current location by fetching your position. The app supports adding and removing multiple cities and provides hourly and daily forecast data. It allows users can add, delete cities and when you click the city you have added it will show the weather information of that city. With its user-friendly UI and a drawer menu for easy navigation, the app also integrates map functionality where users can view weather conditions at different locations by tapping on the map.
